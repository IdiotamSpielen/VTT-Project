# Self-Hosted VTT

## Motivation

The motivation for this project can most accurately be defined as spite.  
It is unacceptable that Wizards of the Coast forces you to pay full price for digital versions of books
you already bought physical copies of...  
also at full price  
And I refuse to pay a monthly subscription for something that could be done with a local application and a Discord server!

Well, the Discord server will not be created by this, but I'm currently working on the application.  

## compatibility

This software has been **Developed for Windows systems**,  
However, due to the cross-platform nature of Java, it may also be compatible with Linux and MacOS.  
**I GUARANTEE NOTHING!** Not even that it works on a Windows System.  

Designed for Dungeons and Dragons 5E specifically, but you may use it for other systems, I'm not your dad.  
(Maybe it'll get dedicated support for other RPG-Systems if I feel like it)  
Made for Game Masters, but Players could also use it. Again, I'm not your dad.  

## database info

Currently the "database" works with json-files saved on your hard-drive.  
In later stages it is supposed to be able to access a database that you connect yourself.

## intended Functionality

### Library

The library functionality of this Software will contain any material  
(e.g. spells, abilities, creatures, classes and races) that you have added.    
**No entries are provided with the Software.**

### character management

Be it character sheets for players or NPC sheets for Game Masters. Easily created, updated and altered.  
I have to reiterate **These characters are not provided with the software**

### Maps, Tokens and all the things between

Much like with the library, you can import any and all images you like.  
as maps, tokens or whatever else you might need.
Obviously, since I cannot access your Computer in programming, once again:  
**these assets are not provided with the Software.**

## Disclaimer

I'm *probably* in the clear with this, but I'm not taking any chances.  
Let's be honest, we know how Hasbro likes to fuck over its fans. As such:  
You may **modify, use and distribute** this software however you please.  
I will not provide any support that goes beyond the instructions found in this README and other documentation.  
This software **does not** come with any entries and is initially **not connected** to any database.  
You will have to host the database yourself or look for another way to host it.  
I **will not** host any databases for you nor will I support you in setting up or finding someone to host your own database.  
(As of now Databases are not functional anyway.)  

**I do not condone the unlawful distribution of copyrighted materials using this software,
nor do I take liability for any consequences you may face by publishing content you created using this software.**
