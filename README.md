# Self-Hosted VTT

## Motivation

The motivation for this project can most accurately be defined as spite.  
It is unacceptable that Wizards of the Coast forces you to pay full price for digital versions of books
you already bought physical copies of...  
also at full price  
And I refuse to pay a monthly subscription for something that could be done with a local application and a Discord server!

Well, the Discord server will not be created by this, but I'm currently working on the application.

## database info

Currently the "database" works with json-files saved on your hard-drive.  
In later stages it is supposed to be able to access a database that you connect yourself.

## intended Functionality

### Library

The library functionality of this Software will contain any material  
(e.g. spells, abilities, creatures, classes and races) that you have added.  
In later versions you should be able to import PDFs and similar files.  
**No entries are provided with the Software.**

### character management

Be it character sheets for players or NPC sheets for yourself. Easily created, updated and altered.  
I have to reiterate **These characters are not provided with the software**

### Maps, Tokens and all the things between

Much like with the library, you can import any and all images you like.  
as maps, tokens or whatever else you might need.
Obviously, since I cannot access your Computer in programming, once again:
**these assets are not provided with the Software.**
