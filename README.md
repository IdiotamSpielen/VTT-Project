# intended VTT Functionality

## Library

The library functionality of this program will contain any spells, abilities, creatures, classes and races that you have added.
In later versions you should be able to import PDFs and similar files. None of these entries are provided with the program.

## character management

Wether it be character sheets for players or NPC sheets for yourself. Easily created, updated and altered.

## Maps, Tokens and all the things between

Much like with the library, you can import any images you like as maps, tokens or whatever else you might need.
these assets are also not provided with the program.
